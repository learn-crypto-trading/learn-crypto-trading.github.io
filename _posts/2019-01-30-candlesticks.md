## Shadows

Long shadows serve as an indicator of the comparative strengths
between the buyers and the sellers. The longer the shadow, the more likely prices move in the opposite direction.

## Doji

<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/article/hammer-doji-bullish-reversal-candlestick-patterns-cm728687"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hUApwQO.png"></a>

All doji are created when price closes at or around the same price as opening, and all gains or losses are returned. The length and direction of the shadow are important indicators. Doji commonly appear when there is indecision in the market, at a turning point in a trend. 

You will find it during periods of resting after big moves
higher or lower. When found at the bottom or top of a trend, it is a sign that trend is losing strength.

As an indecisive indicator, look for confirmation.

### Shooting Star
**Shooting Star is supposed to be a bearish reversal** occuring in an uptrend. [Accoring to bulkowski](http://thepatternsite.com/ShootingStar.html) that reversal happens only 60% of the time.

Overall I will pass on these, since there is no clear indication from either.


### Abandoned Baby

Well performing bearish continuation 60% according to bulkowski. According to prevailing thought its a reversal pattern.

The following are the top performing candlesticks from a pirated copy of Bulkowski's rankings that I can't include here:

Another I'll pass on until I can DYOR.
